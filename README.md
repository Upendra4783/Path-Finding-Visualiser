#### PATH FINDING ALGORITHM

At its core, a pathfinding algorithm seeks to find the shortest path between two points.This application visualises various pathfinding algorithms in action.
Here, We are using all the algorithms for a 2D grid.
Currently, we are using 5 path finding Algorithms. 

1.A* -AStar 

2.Dijkstra 

3.Greedy Best-First Search

4.Breadth-First Search (BFS)

5.Depth-First Search(DFS)
